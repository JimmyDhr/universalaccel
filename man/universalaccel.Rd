\title{universalaccel: Unified Accelerometry Metrics}
\description{
A unified framework for computing harmonized accelerometry metrics across ActiGraph, Axivity, and GENEActiv devices.
}
\details{
This package provides harmonized metric computation across ActiGraph, Axivity, and GENEActiv devices.
It includes ENMO, MAD, MIMS, AI, ROCAM, and counts, with support for calibrated input and reproducible pipelines.

\code{universalaccel} is designed for researchers, data scientists, and developers working with raw accelerometry data.
It is suitable for physical activity researchers, public health analysts, and developers building reproducible pipelines.

For a quick overview, see the README at \url{https://github.com/JimmyDhr/universalaccel}.
For developer validation, run \code{source("tools/preflight.R")} from the package root.
For interactive exploration, launch the Shiny app via \code{run_calibrated_data_app()}.
